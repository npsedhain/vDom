## Description

Virtual DOM implementation that is the minimal clone of react js.

### Basic features

- Primitive diffing algorithm for updating only the changed components.
- The life cycle hooks implementation of class based components in `React`.

### Implementation 

- It uses the most minimal form of diffing algorithm and maintains a tree to compare the various states.


### Demo

- The project consists of the most common `to-do` list you can find in the internet, but it has been re-written in this version of `virtual dom`.
- This doesn't support JSX like tags and has simple function based approach to create new elements. Just as `React.createElement`.

### Use it in your own project

- You can also use it in your own project and play around with the features. Download the package by
  `npm i virtual-dom-implementation`

### Contribute

- If you wish to make it better and add any kind of feature or see a bug that needs fixing, feel free to open PR. (Fork into your own and compare between forks)

### Finding

- There is no magic in code! :)
